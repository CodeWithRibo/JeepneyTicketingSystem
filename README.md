The Jeepney Ticketing System, inspired by the innovative practices on Karuhatan Road in Valenzuela, transforms the traditional way of purchasing jeepney tickets. By introducing a digital ticketing system, it ensures a convenient, secure, and efficient process for passengers. The system not only mirrors the unique toy coin method but also brings real-time updates, accessibility, and environmental benefits, significantly enhancing the overall passenger experience

**BUY TICKET** <br>
 One of the standout features of the Jeepney Ticketing System is the ability to purchase tickets online. Passengers can easily buy tickets via the official website. This online platform offers a range of payment options, making it convenient for users to secure their tickets in advance. Once the transaction is completed, passengers receive a digital ticket with a unique ticket number, which can be shown to the conductor when boarding the jeepney.
