 One of the standout features of the Jeepney Ticketing System is the ability to purchase tickets online. Passengers can easily buy tickets via the official website. This online platform offers a range of payment options, making it convenient for users to secure their tickets in advance. Once the transaction is completed, passengers receive a digital ticket with a unique ticket number, which can be shown to the conductor when boarding the jeepney.
